"""File-backed owned-tab registry with instance-id keying and heartbeat lease.

Solves the orphan-tab problem: each fresh bridge process creates its own
ChatGPT tab via ``Target.createTarget``, but the owned ``_target_id`` is
in-memory state that doesn't survive a process restart. So a killed+restarted
process left its prior tab open and created another — tab accumulation.

This registry persists the owned tab per *logical bridge instance* so a
restarted process can reclaim its own prior tab instead of creating a new one.
It is NOT cross-session adoption (the bug that corrupted conversation routing):
two processes with different ``instance_id``s never touch each other's entries,
and a process never reclaims an entry whose owner is provably still alive.

Design (agreed in collaborative review):
  - File at ``~/.anklient/owned_tabs.json``, keyed by ``instance_id``.
  - ``instance_id`` derived from configured identity (chrome profile + cdp
    port + server/transport identity), overridable via ``W2A_INSTANCE_ID``.
  - Heartbeat lease: each entry carries ``owner_pid`` + ``heartbeat_at``. A
    fresh heartbeat (< TTL) means occupied — do not reclaim. A stale heartbeat
    (owner dead, or heartbeat older than TTL) means reclaimable.
  - ``reclaim()`` is an ATOMIC CLAIM: it holds the portalocker file lock across
    read + validate + write-new-owner, so two processes can't both decide to
    reclaim the same entry. No CAS/version field needed.
  - No global reaping by default. Reclaim touches only this instance's entry.
