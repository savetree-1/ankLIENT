"""Cross-process async lock for serializing mutating operations.

The driver and its browser tab are shared resources — multiple MCP server
processes (one per ZCode agent session) and/or the REST server can all be
attached to the same Chrome tab on the same CDP port. The existing
``asyncio.Lock`` in each server is process-local and provides zero mutual
exclusion across processes.

This module provides an async context manager wrapping ``portalocker`` (a
cross-platform file-lock library) so all processes that share a Chrome
instance serialize their mutating operations (sends, creates, deletes).

The lock is keyed on the CDP port plus an optional ``lock_key`` suffix
(``~/.anklient/cdp-{port}[-{key}].lock``) so multiple Chrome instances
on different ports get independent locks, and so different lock *purposes*
within one Chrome get independent locks too. The two purposes today:

  - mutation locks: ``lock_key=None`` (legacy port-wide) or
    ``lock_key="target-{targetId}"`` (per-tab, parallel mode)
  - lifecycle election: ``lock_key="chrome-launch"`` (cold-start launch race)

Usage::

    async with CrossProcessLock(cdp_port=9222):
        # exclusive across all processes on this port (legacy behavior)
        await driver.send_and_stream(...)

    async with CrossProcessLock(cdp_port=9222, lock_key=target_lock_key(tid)):
        # exclusive per-tab — other tabs on the same Chrome run in parallel

Design notes:
  - Acquire uses a **non-blocking poll loop** (``LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB`` +
    ``await asyncio.sleep``), never a blocking ``to_thread`` call. The
    previous implementation wrapped a blocking ``portalocker.lock(LOCK_EX)``
    in ``asyncio.to_thread`` + ``asyncio.wait_for``; on timeout the worker
    thread was not killed and could acquire the OS lock *after* the coroutine
    had given up. The poll loop has deterministic cancellation semantics —
    no leaked background thread can grab the lock post-abandonment.
  - A timeout on acquire (default 120s, matching the typical send timeout)
    prevents indefinite hangs when a prior holder crashed. On timeout, raises
    ``LockAcquisitionError`` which surfaces as a clean MCP/REST error.
  - ``portalocker.LOCK_SHARED`` is NOT used — this is an exclusive lock.
    Read-only operations run lock-free by design (concurrent reads are safe;
    only DOM-mutating operations need serialization).
  - ``lock_key`` is validated against a safe charset to prevent path
    traversal / separator injection in the lock filename.
